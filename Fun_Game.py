# Kids on a picnic decided to play fun game and find the area of circle they are sitting on. 
# Assume the radius of circle to be some floating numbers.

# Area of a Circle

# In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius r is πr2. 
# Here the Greek letter π represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, 
# which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.

radius = float(input())
Area_of_circle = 3.14159 * radius * radius

print("The area of circle is :", Area_of_circle)
