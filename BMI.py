# Question 1
# Write a Python program to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI).

# Note: Body mass index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. 
# The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², 
# resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. If your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9, it falls within the Healthy Weight range.

# Answer 1

mass = float(input())
height = float(input())

BMI = mass/ (height * height)

print(BMI)
